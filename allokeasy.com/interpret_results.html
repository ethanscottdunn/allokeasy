  <h1>Interpret Results</h1>
  <p>You should see 3 cards of results, each with a Return, Standard Deviation, Sharpe, and Taxes Paid. The Return, Standard Deviation, and Sharpe are exactly that, for the portfolio in question. The Taxes Paid is the amount you would owe for realizing the gains in your portfolio by implementing the given portfolio. It is $0 for the current portfolio as no changes would be made, and it is the largest for the "optimized" portfolio because it does not consider the impact to portfolio returns of paying this expense. It will be somewhere in between for the "tax-optimized" portfolio. The "optimized" portfolio shows two Returns and Sharpe ratios because these numbers can be computed before and after considering taxes, which can change the performance significantly (from the best option without paying taxes, to the worst option with paying taxes)</p>
