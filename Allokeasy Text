There is no optimal portfolio, but that does not justify keeping 90% of your net worth in a single company.

"But I don't want to pay taxes on my gains!"

I know. Nor should you. Taxes cause a real drag on your portfolio, and you should trade off the impact it has on your returns.

"But that's hard!"

Not really. But this website makes it trivial. Here's how it works:

1) Upload your portfolio holdings (Vanguard)
2) Fill in your income, filing status, and risk free rate of return
	a) Income is required to calculate your marginal tax rate
	b) Filing Status is required to calculate your marginal tax rate
	c) Risk Free Rate is required to optimize your portfolio
